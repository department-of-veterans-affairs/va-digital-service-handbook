### Team activities

All Veteran Tools Platform teams will do these activities

* Analyze user needs and turn those into user stories
* Create user stories and prioritize them
* Design, build, test and iterate software, and deploy software
* Test with real users
* Support the live running of the service (monitoring and evaluating metrics, fixing bugs, conducting ongoing user research and usability testing, continue building and releasing new features from the backlog, ensure the service continues to meet the [Digital Standard]({{ "digital-standard" | relative_url }}))
* Manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams

### Team roles

To do that, you'll want the following roles on your team.

* Product management &mdash; set strategy and define features; manage stakeholders
* User research &mdash; conduct user research and analysis; usability testing
* User experience designer &mdash; turn research insights into design decisions; designs the end-to-end user experience based on user research
* Content strategy &mdash; including knowledge of accessibility (or access to accessibility experts)
* Technical &mdash; architecture; development; quality assurance; testing; deployment
* Policy &mdash; relevant subject-matter expertise (and the desire to improve policy)
* Performance evaluation &mdash; continuous measurement and analysis
* Project management &mdash; manage agile delivery; manage the team's work with policy, legal, finance, and communications teams

  > Not all roles will be needed in every phase. Some roles may be needed less than full-time during some phases. Team members will need to adapt based on the needs of the service and the phase of work.
