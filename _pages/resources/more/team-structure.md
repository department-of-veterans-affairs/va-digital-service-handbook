### Team activities

All Veteran Tools Platform teams will do these activities

* Analyze user needs and turn those into user stories
* Create user stories and prioritize them
* Design, build, test and iterate, and deploy software
* Test with real users
* Support the live running of the service (monitoring and evaluating metrics, fixing bugs, conducting ongoing user research and usability testing, continue building and releasing new features from the backlog, ensure the service continues to meet the [Digital Standards]({{site.baseurl}}/digital-standards))
* Manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams

### Team roles

To do that, you'll want the following skillsets on your team.

* **Product Management** &mdash; set strategy and define features; manage stakeholders
* **User Research** &mdash; conduct user research; analyze findings and make recommendations; conduct user testing of different types (e.g., usability testing and card sorting)
* **User Experience Design** &mdash; turn research insights into design decisions; designs the end-to-end user experience based on user research
* **Content Strategy/Writing** &mdash; ability to write new content following the guidelines in the content style guide; understanding of relationship between content and accessibility (or access to accessibility experts)
* **Technical** &mdash; architecture; development; quality assurance; testing; deployment
* **Policy** &mdash; relevant subject-matter expertise (and the desire to improve policy); this skillset may come from your internal team or from an external stakeholder
* **Performance Evaluation** &mdash; continuous measurement and analysis
* **Project Management** &mdash; manage agile delivery; manage the team's work with policy, legal, finance, and communications teams

  > Some skillsets may be needed less than full-time during some phases. Team members will need to adapt based on the needs of the service and the phase of work.
