### By the end of this phase, you should have answers to these questions


<div class="bullet-checkmark" markdown="1">


* Does the MVP service meet the basic needs of your users?

* Does it work correctly in the production environment at scale and including all integrations?

* If needed, are the right policies or processes in place to support the MVP when it launches?

* Has the team successfully completed all [the pre-launch activities]({{site.baseurl}}/delivery/build-and-test/activities#pre-launch-activities)?


</div>

### Completing this phase

#### 1. Schedule a [Checkpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/checkpoint) meeting at the end of this phase.

* **Note**: The expectation is that you will launch the MVP after the Checkpoint meeting. Be sure you've completed all the [the pre-launch activities]({{site.baseurl}}/delivery/build-and-test/activities#pre-launch-activities) before then.

#### 2. At the Checkpoint meeting, be prepared with the following:


<div class="bullet-checkmark" markdown="1">

* A fully-functioning MVP service that meets your users' basic needs

* A list of major bugs and usability issues that have been identified and fixed

* The metrics you'll use to measure the success of your MVP

* Documentation of the user research and testing you did in the *Build and Test* phase

* A proposed plan for how you'll improve the service after you launch it &mdash; how you'll monitor, evaluate, user research/test, and build from your backlog

* A prioritized backlog of features you plan to build after MVP launch in order to improve the service

</div>
