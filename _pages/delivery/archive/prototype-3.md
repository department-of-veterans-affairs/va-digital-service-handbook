<div class="bullet-checkmark" markdown="1">

* Have you defined the right MVP service to meet the basic needs of your users?

* What existing (and/or new) design patterns are needed for the MVP?

* What APIs will the MVP use (if any), and how do you plan to use them?

* What integrations are required for the MVP (if any), and how do you plan to integrate them?

* What existing processes or policies need to change to support the MVP (if any)?

* What are the metrics you'll use to measure the success of the MVP, and what is your plan to get those metrics?

* A prioritized list of user stories and features for the MVP service (i.e., your backlog)

* A clear understanding of the technology that will support the MVP service (and an understanding of how the technology might evolve for later releases)

* An understanding of other VA systems you need to replace or integrate with

* A proposed set of metrics you'll use to measure your serviceâ€™s success (and how you'll get them)
