* What technical solutions or approaches are best suited to integrate with existing Veteran Tools Platform technologies?

### Activities

* **[Identify your goals]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/prototype-activities#identify-your-goals)** for the *Prototype* phase.

* **[Plan design sprints]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/prototype-activities#plan-your-design-sprints)** that answer the questions you identified in your goals.

* **[Conduct design sprints]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/prototype-activities#conduct-a-design-sprint)** to test the hypotheses you identified in your goals.

* Document findings from your prototyping activities.

* Based on your prototyping findings, create a clear definition and design of the MVP your team plans to build, including all user stories and features.

* Create a list of user stories and features that you plan to build *after the MVP launch*.

* Document the technology needed to support the MVP, as well as any business or policy changes required by the MVP.

* Create a timeline and plan for the *Build and Test* phase.
  * Be sure you **understand [the pre-launch activities]({{site.baseurl}}/delivery/build-and-test/activities#pre-launch-activities)** so you can create an effective *Build and Test* plan.
