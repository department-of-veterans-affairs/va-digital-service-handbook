### What is the *Research + Discovery* phase?

It's tempting to start brainstorming solutions right away based on your understanding of your project. Doing that leads to a solution-focused design process in which your team's primary question is: *How do we build the solution?*

Instead focus on a user-centered design process in which your team's primary questions are: *Who are the potential users of my service, and how can we design a service that meets their needs?*

Your goal in the *Research + Discovery* phase is to **learn about real users and identify the problem(s) your service could solve for them**. The best way to do this is to [talk to real users]({{ site.baseurl}}/resources/user-research). Go out and find people who will be using the service. Talk to them, observe them, and learn what they need and want.
