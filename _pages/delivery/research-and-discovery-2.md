### Key questions to answer

* Who are your users?
* What are they trying to do?
* What tasks are they trying to accomplish? And how do they do that currently?
* What problems or frustrations do they experience in trying to achieve their goals?
* What do users need from your service to achieve their goals?
* If your research findings show a need for the service, how would you start building a technical solution?

### Activities

* Define a **[problem statement]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/problem-statement)** that you think your service will solve for your users.

* Conduct **[user research]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/user-research)** to learn about potential users of your service through interviews, observation, and testing.

* Determine your primary user groups.

* Analyze any existing VA or private-sector services that meet user needs.

* Understand current VA policy, technology, and business process related to your service.

* Identify policy, technical, or other barriers that could make it difficult to meet user needs.

* Review the <a title="Go to developer documentation" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/getting-started" target="_blank">**developer documentation**</a> and conduct **[technical discovery]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/technical-discovery)**.

* **[Document findings]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/research-readout)** from your user research and technical exploration

* Use insights from your findings to create a plan for what the team will work on during the *Prototype* phase
