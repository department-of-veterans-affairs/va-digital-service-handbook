title: Prototype introduction
description: The <i>Prototype</i> phase is about prototyping and testing hypotheses with users so you can decide how to meet the user needs you identified in <i>Research and Discovery</i>. Use this phase as your chance to test many different approaches with real users before building your service.

### What is the *Prototype* phase?

* The primary objective of the *Prototype* phase is to answer the question: *How can your team best meet the user needs you identified in Research and Discovery?*

* The primary outcome of the *Prototype* phase is *a clear definition of your **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and a solid plan for how you'll build it.*
  <blockquote class="plain-blockquote">
  <b>The MVP is the first working version of your service</b>, which you'll build in the next phase &mdash; <i>Build and Test</i>.
  <br/><br/>Your MVP will be the smallest set of working functionality you can build that provides value to your users by meeting basic user needs.
  <br/><br/>The <i>Prototype</i> phase is about figuring out what those basic user needs are, and how you'll meet them.
  </blockquote>

During the *Prototype* phase, you'll iteratively design and test potential solutions. You'll build prototypes quickly and test them with users. You'll then use the feedback and testing results to improve the next prototype.

You'll repeat this process until the prototype meets your users' needs and your team is confident they know what the MVP will be and how to build it.
