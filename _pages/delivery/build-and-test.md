timeframe: |
  * Different services will spend different amounts of time in the *Build and Test* phase, depending on what the team plans to build as the MVP. In general, plan to spend
    * 6-8 weeks for a new feature
    * 8-12 weeks for a new service
    * **Note**: If your planned MVP will take longer than 12 weeks to build and test, you should reconsider the [scope of your MVP](/va-digital-service-handbook/resources/more/mvp-scope).

### What is the *Build and Test* phase?

In the *Build and Test* phase, it's tempting to try to build all the features and functionality you imagine for your service. But stay focused on your vision for the MVP. **As soon as your service can provide value by meeting basic user needs, itâ€™s ready to launch!**

During this phase, you'll build the user stories and features from your backlog in small batches of functionality. As you build these batches, you'll test them with your users to ensure they work well. Then you'll use that user feedback to refine your service, adding and adjusting features until your MVP service is complete.

The final step in the *Build and Test* phase is to launch the MVP, which you'll do after the Checkpoint meeting.
