### Planning your research sprint
Planning a research sprint is a lot like creating a research plan for your service. The difference is that it's targeted to a specific timeframe and is designed to answer your most immediate questions &mdash; the questions that must be answered in order for the team to decide what to do next.

You can use the template below to plan a research sprint with your team.

### Template: Plan a research sprint

**What is our current problem statement and corresponding solution hypothesis?**
* Why do we want to do this research?

<br/>
**What are our immediate questions for this research sprint?**
  * What do we need to know now that will us decide what to do in the next sprint?
<br/>

**What information do we want to get from this testing?**
<br/>

**What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?**
<br/>

**What kinds of users do we need to talk to in order to answer our questions?**
  * What specific questions do we need to ask on our screener in order to get the right kinds of users to test with?
<br/>

**What kind of user research do we want to do?**
  * What user research method(s) are best suited to get us the answers we need?
  * If there are multiple user research methods that might work, which one do we want to use?
<br/>

**What testing and recording tools do we need in order to run the research sessions using these methods with these types of users?**
<br/>

**What artifacts do we need in order to get users to answer the questions we have?**
  * Do we need a clickable prototype?
      * If so, do we have one ready?
      * If not, what would it take to make one?
  * If we need a prototype but don't have one ready, what lower-fidelity ways could we get users to answer our questions?
      * Showing a competitor service?
      * Showing sketches?
      * Showing paper prototypes?
<br/>

**What kind of research sessions do we want?**
  * In-person vs remote?
  * Moderated vs unmoderated?
<br/>

**Who will fill the team roles?**
  * Recruiter?
  * Conversation guide writer?
  * Prototype maker?
  * Moderator? If not moderated, who will set up the unmoderated research session?  
  * Note-taker?
  * Observers?
  * Research readout writer?
<br/>

**When do we want to do this testing?**
<br/>

**When do we need to start recruiting in order to do that?**
